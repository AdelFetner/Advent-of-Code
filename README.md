# Advent of Code
Repository with all Advent of Code's advents. '22 edition.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of code is a yearly advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## My objective with '22 edition's Advent of Code

I aim to get better at JavaScript and at my programming logic skill, most of my advents will be done in JS. This is a repository to archive all my progress for future remembering.
